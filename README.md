The project entails a comprehensive time series analysis of airline passenger behavior. Employing Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) methodology, the analysis delves into the intricate patterns within the temporal data, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the underlying trends and seasonality.

SARIMA, or Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, is an advanced time series forecasting technique that combines autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components, incorporating seasonality to provide a robust framework for predicting future values in time series data.

To enhance interpretability, visual aids in the form of graphs have been generated. These visual representations serve to elucidate complex patterns and trends within the airline passenger data, facilitating a more intuitive comprehension of the observed temporal dynamics. This meticulous approach to time series analysis aims to uncover valuable insights and contribute to informed decision-making in the context of airline passenger behavior.
